Keras- Neural networ API written in python and integrated with tensorflow
Fine tune state of the art model according to our needs

Why Keras - Keras was built to enable fast user experimentation so its easy to go from idea to implementation in very few steps

Also if you have the fundamental understanding of underlying concepts then the miners and tacticals and implementaion diferences between different APIs shouldn't really be that hard to catch on.

DATA PROCESSING-> 

Data should be in the format which neural network is able to accept

the NN receives the data whenever we call the fit function on model

x=input data should be a numpy array or a dict mapping input names to corresponding tensors
y=target data should be in a same fashion as input data
